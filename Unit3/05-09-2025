Unit 3
1) String 
2) Collections
3) Date and Time
4) java New Features

String 
1) String is not a Data type
2) String is Character Sequence / Char Array

string a = "Hello";
string b = "Hello";

a = 100x -> "Hello"
b = 200x -> "Hello"

String pool -> Set -> will never allow duplicates
String str1 = "Hello" -> 100x
String str2 = "Hello" -> 100x


mutable & immutable

Integer,Float,Character -> Wrapper Classe -> Final Classe
Integer a = 10 -> a = 20
Integr b = 10

String is also immutable
String a = "hello" - 250x
String b = "hello" - 250x
hello welcome ->new Memore 
a = a+" Welcome"; - > "hello"+ " welcome" -> hello welcome

a = hello welcome

TO MAKE STRING AS MUTTABLE we have 2 classes
1) StringBuffer ->1.1 -> Tread Safe -> Take more time to precess
2) StringBuilder ->1.4 -> not Thread Safe -> Time Efficient


Define a String 
1) Literal -> String Literal
    "Hello"
2) String str = new String("Hello");
 + -> will always act as a concatenation in java
 == ->  always check for references not the value
 equals() -> check both the values are same.
 s1.equals(s2) -> True / False

 Substring(start index,end index)
 start index -> is always inclusuive
 end index -> is not inclusuive
String methods -> reverse is not present;

if we want to use reverse then my string should be mutable

2 ways to make my string mutable
1) StringBuffer
2) StringBuilder

all the objects create as mutable will be stored onl;y in heap
its memory willnot be created in string pool
